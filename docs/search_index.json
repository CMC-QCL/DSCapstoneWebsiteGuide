Groups of students under the guidance of faculty advisors will be working with client liaisons on cleaning, querying, analyzing, and modeling data for businesses, non-profit organizations, and public agencies. Participating clients will get much needed data projects off the ground while establishing relationship with the College by assisting in the training of the next generation of employable undergraduates in data science and data analytics. Program Goals:  To establish ongoing Industry-Academia partnership.  To help utilize clients data for data-oriented business development and data-driven decision making.  To provide a practical, application-oriented learning environment for data science students.  To develop essential soft skills through professional engagement with industry partners. Program Structure:  Data Science Capstone is a required course for Data Science Major and Sequence (minor): a) A regular one semester course with letter grade b) Pre-requisites: Intro to Programming (Python), Foundation of Data Science (R/RStudio), Statistics (R, STATA, or SPSS), two upper-division electives related to data science in their domain areas c) Possible to continue to the next semester to develop further results with a new group of students  Team Member Structure: a) 3 to 4 senior and junior students who have completed prerequisites and related electives b) 1 or 2 faculty advisors in the clients domain areas c) 1 or 2 client organization liaisons Commitment of Students:  A Statement of Work (SoW)* detailing the intended goals, methodology, and deliverables will be created for client approval.

A site visit is recommended if the Covid-19 pandemic situation may get better during the semester.  There are no financial obligations for the client to participate in the CMC Data Science Capstone Program in the Fall 2022. It may become a paid program in the Spring 2023. ** The MOU ensures confidentiality, privacy, security, the use of data sets and results as well as protected "],["adding-clients-and-projects.html", "Section 3 Adding Clients and Projects", " Section 3 Adding Clients and Projects You will have to go into projects tab make a clients page and a project page You will have to use Divi and copy another client page or projects and edit it Make sure to add project to clients page and Projects page, clients should be automatically added to clients page.
