Groups of students under the guidance of faculty advisors will be working with client liaisons on cleaning, querying, analyzing, and modeling data for businesses, non-profit organizations, and public agencies. Participating clients will get much needed data projects off the ground while establishing relationship with the College by assisting in the training of the next generation of employable undergraduates in data science and data analytics. Program Goals: • To establish ongoing Industry-Academia partnership. • To help utilize client’s data for data-oriented business development and data-driven decision making. • To provide a practical, application-oriented learning environment for data science students. • To develop essential soft skills through professional engagement with industry partners.
